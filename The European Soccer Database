#The Europen Soccer Dataset
### by David Alobo
## Introduction

In this project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicated my findings about it using the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make the analysis easier. I went through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.
In this research, I used Jupyter Notebook to examine a Kaggle dataset called the European Soccer Database. I chose this dataset since it required SQL to combine the tables, I enjoy sports, and I hope to employ Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to improve team performance and forecast game outcomes in the near future.

This project, seek to provide answers to the following questions below:

- What teams improved the most over the time period? 
- Which players had the most penalties? 
- What team attributes lead to the most victories?

## Objectives

- Identify the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- To be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a useable format
- Communicate the results of my analysis
- Use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up data analysis code
- use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

## Dataset

The European Soccer Database offers information on soccer matches, players, and teams from a variety of European countries from 2008 to 2016 which was stored in SQLite database and accessed via SQLite db browser installed on my local computer.

The schema has 7 tables, which are:

- Team 
- Country
- League
- Match
- Player
- Player_attributes
- Team_Attributes

The tables were collapsed into 2 tables, which are player_data and Team Performance using SQL Query, and the result was exported as a csv file.
